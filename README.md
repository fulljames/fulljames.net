### The least possible website I could get away with

Now running on [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) because it makes life easy.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.astro`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
