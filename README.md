### The least possible website I could get away with

Now running on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) because it makes life easy.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
